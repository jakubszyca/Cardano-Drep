    "comment": "I vote yes for this proposal because I believe open-source, neutral, and community-owned governance tools are essential to keeping governance alive and improving participation. I think the full amount (Level 3) should be allocated not only to maintain but also to improve the tool. Other governance tools, like Tempo, offer features that I believe GovTool should implement, some of which are already included in the proposed roadmap and require funding. Overall, GovTool provides a much stronger foundation and has a proven track record. It's good to have multiple options for users, but I see GovTool as the backbone of Cardano governance, and as such, it should be prioritized for development. I was disappointed that it wasn't included in the Intersect budget for 2025, and I hope this new proposal will be approved."
