I am fully in favor of this budget. It shows clear goals and steps to get to them with transparency in place. Cardano ecosystem needs more tier-one integrations and this finally seems like a step to make it a reality. It's great to see that all of our institutions are working together to achieve this goal. I like the funds management in this proposal i.e. that funds will be gradually withdrawn as objectives are met and whatever is left will go back to the treasury. I think that this proposal will visibly change the Cardano DeFi ecosystem and truly let it break-through to the blockchain mainstream."}}
