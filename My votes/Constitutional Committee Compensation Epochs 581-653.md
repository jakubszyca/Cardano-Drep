## Vote context
While I am not opposed to compensating different parts of Cardano governance in principle, I cannot support this governance action. First, the proposal provides insufficient justification for requesting 1,000,000 ADA. The amount appears arbitrary and, in my view, excessive. Second, compensation should apply equitably to all members of the Constitutional Committee, not only a selected few. This matter should be revisited only after the proponents provide a detailed rationale for determining appropriate compensation.
