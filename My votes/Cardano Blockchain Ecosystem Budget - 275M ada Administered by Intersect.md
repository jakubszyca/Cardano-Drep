## Vote context
I voted YES for the first Cardano Ecosystem Budget. The budget process was difficult and chaotic. To be honest it was hard to follow but that's expected on first try. In the end I believe implemented improvements made everything more transparent and involved the community more.

This budget bases itself on the Cardano Roadmap which I voted for and have great confidence in. All the major projects secured funding and that will help Cardano grow. I like the fact that Catalyst is still getting significant amounts of ADA. It's an essential growth-hack tool with decentralization at it's heart. Very much needed part of our ecosystem which proved it's worth over the years with many projects still relying on its support.

Only thing I'm not content with is the lack of GovTool funding. I believe it should be kept alive and get funding for improvements and maintenance. Maybe in some time as more wallets and other tools roll out governance support it won't be needed but as of now I believe it to be essential for open governance in our ecosystem.

This budget is a very impressive milestone achieved by the community. It wasn't easy, there were conflicts, ups and downs but in the end the community got together and compromised. This is exactly what decentralized governance is for and it honestly warms my heart that people from all over the world can work together to achieve their goals. If we can keep it up over the years this ecosystem will grow and turn a revolution into reality.
